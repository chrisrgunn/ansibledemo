# ansibledemo

Ansible is used in this demo to SSH into our remote AWS EC2 instance to run two automated tasks for webserver deployment - updating all packages and installing Nginx. The EC2 webserver is brought up on port 80 via HTTP and shows simple "Hello World" text to show that it has been deployed.
